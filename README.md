**Create Branch**
Branching is a way to work on differnt versions of a repository at a time.By default,our repository has one branch called main.
We use branches to experiment and make edits before committing to main.When you create branch of main, you're making a copy,or snapshot of main as it was at that point.
If someone else made changes to the main branch while you were working on your branch, you could pull in those updates.
**Steps**
1.Go to your new repository hello-world.
2.Click the drop down at the top of file list that says branch:main.
3.Type a branch name, readme-edits ,into the new branch text box.
4.Select the blue create branch box or hit "Enter" on keyboard.
5.Now you have 2 branches, main and readme-edits.

**Open pull Request**
Pull requests are heart of collaboration.When you open a pull request, you're proposing your changes and requesting that someone review and pull in your contribution and merge them into thier branch.
Pull Requests show differences ,of the content from both branches.The changes ,additions and subtractions are shown in green and red.
As soon as you make a commit, you can open a pull request and start a discussion ,even before the code is finished.
By using @mention system in your pull request message, you can ask for feedback from specific people or teams.
**Steps**

**Understanding The Github Flow**
Github flow is a light weight, branch-based workflow that supports teams and projects where deployements are made regularly.
**Create a branch**
When you're working on a projkect, you're going to have a bunch of different ideas or features in progress at any given time-some of which are ready to go and some of which are not.Branching exists to help you manage this workflow.When you create a branch in your project, you're creating an environment where you can try out new ideas.Changes you make on a branch don't affect main branch,so you're free to experiment and commit changes ,safe in the knowledge that your branch won't be merged until it's ready to be reviewd by someone you're collaborating with.
**ProTip**
Branching is a core concept in Git, and the entire Github flow is based upon on it. There's only one rule:anything in main branch is always deployable.Because of this, it's extremely important that your new branch is created off of main when working on a feature of fix.Your branch name should be descriptive, so that others can see what is being worked on.
