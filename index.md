<b>GITHUB FLOW</b>
 
*It is light weight, branch-based workflow that supprts teams and projects where deployements are made regularly. When you **create a branch** in project, you're creating an environment where you try out new ideas. Changes you make on a branch dont affect main branch, so you are free to experiment and commit changes, safe in the knowledge that your branch won't be merged until it's ready to be reviewed by someone you're **collaborating** with.Your branch name should be descriptive because it is created off main when working on a **feature** or **fix**.*

<b>GIT HANDBOOK</b>

_Version control system tracks (**VCS**) history of change as people and teams collaborate on projects together. As the project envolves, teams can **run tests**, **fix bugs**, and **contribute new code** with the confidence that any version can be recovered at any time. Developers can also **review project history** to find..._
*  Which changes were made?
*  Who made the changes?
*  When were the changes made?
*  Why were the changes needed?

_Distributed Version control system (**DVCs**) is commonly used for **open source** and **commercial software** development. They allow access to every file, branch and iteration of project, and allow every user access to full and self-contaimed **history** of all changes. Developers can work anywhere and collaborate asynchronously from any time zone._

**BASIC GIT COMMANDS**

* git init - initialize brand new repository
* git clone - create local copy of project
* git add - adding files to snapshot
* git commit - saving the snapshot
* git status - show status of changes
* git branch - show branch worked locally
* git merge - merge line of development
* git pull - update local line of development
* git push - update repository with commits   
 
## HOW GITHUB WORK

_GitHub builds collaboration directly into thye developmenmt process. Work is organized into repositories, where developers can outline requirements or directions and set expectations for team members. Developers simply create a branch to work on updates, commit changes to save them, open a pull request to propose and discuss changes, and merge pull requests once everyone is on same page._

4. git checkout my-branch
5. git add file1.md file2.md
6. git commit -m "my snapshot"
7. git push --set-upstream origin my-branch

* Start new repository and publish it on GitHub

4. Select a theme
5. Write your content
6.Commit changes

### FORKING PROJECTS

_Creating a **fork** is producing personal copy of someone else's project. It acts as a sort of bridge between **original repository** and your **personal copy**. You can submit PULL Requests to help make other people's project better by offering your changes upto the original project.Pull Requests are an area of discussion._

It is **core** of **Social coding** on GitHub.

1. Fork the repository in header.
2. Clone or Download
3. Making and Pushing changes
4. Making a Pull Request
5. Compare and Pull Request
6. Create Pull Request

## BE SOCIAL

_With more and more people joining GitHub and adding projects everyday, keeping up with them all can be difficult. This can be **fun** and **easy** by **following users** or **watching reposityories**, or simply showing interst by **starring**, or using **explore** to find out new people and projects._

1. Follow a friend
2. Watch a project's repository
3. Stargazing
4. Discover repositories
5. Explore/Newsletter

### MAKING CITABLE CODE

_**Digital Object Identifiers** are the **backbone** of **academic reference** and **metric systems**. If you're a researcher writing software, this will explain you how to make the work you share on GitHub by **archiving** one of your GitHub **repositories** and assigning a DOI with the data archiving tool **Zenodo**_

1. Choose your repository
2. Login to Zenodo
3. Pick repository to archive
4. Click repository settings
5. Create new release
